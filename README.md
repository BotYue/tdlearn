Linear TD Learning Algorithms
=============================

What is it?
-----------
Most important Temporal Difference Learning methods for linear value function
prediction implemented in python. Included algorithms: GTD, GTD2, TDC, TD(lambda)
LSTD(lambda)

This code is created during a study project at TU Darmstadt, Germany by
Christoph Dann as no public available implementation of these algorithm existed 
so far. The source code is probably not very efficient but should be
a fair reference implementation for reinforcement learning methods in finite
MDPs and can be helpful for learning these algorithms or own experiments.

In addition to pure algorithm some toy MDP examples and experiment settings are
imcluded that are often used in scientific papers.

Requirements
------------
This code is known to run well with
*  Python 2.7
*  Numpy 1.6.1
*  matplotlib 1.1.0
